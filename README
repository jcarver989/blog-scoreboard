A fun scoreboard (sinatra web-app) for the authors of your blogger blog.
See: http://blog-leaderboard.heroku.com for an example

Setup/Install
-------------------

- Clone this repository
- Edit a few lines in config.yaml to add your blogger feed + gravatar hashes
- Run server.rb, eg:


    # if you don't have it already installed
    sudo gem install bundler 
    bundle install
    # browse to localhost:4567
    ruby server.rb 


It's really that easy
